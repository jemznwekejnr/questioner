					<a href=""><h3>Political View Meetup Group</h3></a>
				</div>
				<div class="content-description">
					<p>
						If you are a political junkie, you’ve come to learn that not everyone wants to talk politics with you.  Like picking a candidate or running mate, you have to choose your company carefully at times. If discussing the election season’s  issues, political players and power brokers with friends, family or co-workers goes nowhere — or pushes relationships to a breaking point —  you  may want to find other outlets for spirited debate or nods of agreement. To find politically charged people with whom to hash out the problems and solutions of the day, join the Political View Meetup Group.
